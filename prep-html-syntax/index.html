    <h1 style="color:pink;">My favorite Star Wars character is Rey</h1>

    <p style="color:brown;">I'm not terribly into Star Wars, but I like how she discovers more about her family background and
      ultimately more about who she is and how that intertwines with her overall life purpose. I think it
    just reflects how we're created for "more." It just takes time to figure that out.
